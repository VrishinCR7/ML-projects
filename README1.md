This repository contains two projects demonstrating the use of **Decision Tree Classifiers** on well-known datasets using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

## 📂 Projects  

### 🔹 1. Decision Tree Classifier on the *Iris Dataset*  
- **Dataset**: The [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#iris-plants-dataset) is a classic dataset used in pattern recognition, containing 150 samples of iris flowers from three species (*setosa*, *versicolor*, *virginica*).  
- **Features**:  
  🌸 Sepal length  
  🌸 Sepal width  
  🌸 Petal length  
  🌸 Petal width  
- **Target**: Species of Iris flower.  
- **Notebook Highlights**:  
  ✅ Dataset exploration  
  ✅ Train-test split  
  ✅ Decision Tree Classifier with `scikit-learn`  
  ✅ Tree visualization & performance evaluation

### 🔹 2. Decision Tree Classifier on the *Titanic Dataset*  
- **Dataset**: The [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) contains passenger information from the Titanic disaster, including survival outcome.  
- **Features (examples)**:  
  🚢 Passenger class (`Pclass`)  
  🚢 Sex  
  🚢 Age  
  🚢 Fare  
  🚢 Embarked location  
- **Target**: Survival status → (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).  
- **Notebook Highlights**:  
  ✅ Data preprocessing (missing values, categorical encoding)  
  ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  ✅ Training a Decision Tree Classifier  
  ✅ Visualization of decision paths  
  ✅ Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall & confusion matrix

Iris Dataset 🌸

Achieves high accuracy in classifying flower species.

Clear decision boundaries visible in the decision tree visualization.

Titanic Dataset 🚢

Captures key survival factors (e.g., class, sex, age).

Shows the interpretability of decision trees but also their tendency to overfit complex datasets.

📝 Notes

🛠 Titanic dataset requires preprocessing due to missing values & categorical variables.

🌳 Decision Trees are prone to overfitting → tune hyperparameters (max_depth, min_samples_split) for better generalization.

🔍 Visualizations are essential for interpreting decision paths and feature importance.

✨ Enjoy exploring Decision Trees! ✨
